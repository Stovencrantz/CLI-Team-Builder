## Description:
    Our user is assigned with assembling a team to take on a project. The user is initially prompted to fill in information for a manager who will oversee the team, and ask to enter basic information about them (name, id, email, and office number). One they are submitted the user is then prompted what kind of role they would like to add to their team, given the choice between adding an engineer or adding an intern. Depending on which role the user selects they will again be prompted with questions regarding information specific to that role. The user can continue to add members to their team until they are satisfied, upon which we will take the information they input and render each employee as a block of html. We use a function to create an html file that neatly displays each individual employee on our team with their corresponding information.
